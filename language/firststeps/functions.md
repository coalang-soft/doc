Functions are really important. Learn what functions are in general and what you can do with them in CoaLang.

## Functions in general
Functions contain pieces of code and allow you to use them everywhere. Every function has a name you can use to access the function you want.

### Calling Functions
To call a function means to use the code inside it. We already called a function called `print` in the Hello World program:
```
println("Hello World");
```
You can call a function by writing its name, and then write `()`. Between the brackets you can put *parameters* to specify the behavior of the function.
In this case, the function `println` knows how to output something - but not what to output. So we put it as a parameter, in this case the Text `"Hello World"`.
