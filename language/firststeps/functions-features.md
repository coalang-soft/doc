* Functions as values

## Functions as values
You can do everything with functions you can do with other values, for example save in a variable, use as parameter and as return value.
```
//Create a function 'out' that does the same as 'println'
var out = println;
out("Hey");
```

## Function literals

### Closures - A greeter function.
If you return functions, you can do really cool things. In this case we can create greeter functions by specifying how to greet. Then we can
use the generated function, say who we want to greet and output the greeting:
```
def greeter(howToGreet){
  def greet
}
```
