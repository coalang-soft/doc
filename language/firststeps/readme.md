# Introduction to CoaLang
CoaLang is a new programming language. It tries to enable you to program like you are thinking. This is why CoaLang supports many programming
styles. This are the base concepts:

* Functional - You can use functions as Values.
* Dynamic typing - No need to set types. Possible to get the type of a value.
* Compiled for better performance, interpreted to be platform independent.
* Use Libraries written in CoaLang, Java, JavaScript, AntLang and other languages.
* Define own Operators and Syntax.

Here you can find an overview of what you can do with CoaLang.
